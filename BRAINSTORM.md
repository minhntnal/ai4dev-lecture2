## Technology Stack Recommendation

*   **Frontend: React.js with Next.js (TypeScript)**
    *   **Advantage Comment:** React provides a robust, component-based architecture for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Next.js adds server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities, which are crucial for SEO (important for a blog) and performance. TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability, especially for larger projects. This combination is widely adopted and offers excellent developer experience and a rich ecosystem.
*   **Backend/API: Node.js with Express.js (TypeScript)**
    *   **Advantage Comment:** Node.js with Express.js offers a fast, scalable, and efficient backend for building RESTful APIs. Its non-blocking I/O model is well-suited for handling many concurrent connections, which is common for content-heavy websites. Using TypeScript across both frontend and backend allows for code sharing and a unified development experience.
*   **Database/Persistence: PostgreSQL**
    *   **Advantage Comment:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database known for its reliability, feature richness, and strong support for complex queries. It's an excellent choice for storing structured data like user profiles, articles, categories, and comments, ensuring data integrity and scalability. Its extensibility and active community make it a future-proof choice.
*   **Caching: Redis**
    *   **Advantage Comment:** Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It's ideal for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., popular articles, user sessions) to significantly improve application performance and reduce the load on the primary database.
