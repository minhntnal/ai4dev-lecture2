# Project TODO List: Programming Knowledge-Sharing Blog Website

## 1. Project Setup and Initialization

*   [x] [devops] Initialize Git Repository
*   [x] [devops] Project Structure (monorepo: frontend, backend, shared)
*   [x] [frontend] Frontend Setup (Next.js with TypeScript)
    *   [x] [frontend] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
    *   [x] [frontend] Configure ESLint and Prettier
    *   [x] [frontend] Set up basic UI components and styling (e.g., Tailwind CSS)
*   [x] [backend] Backend Setup (Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript)
    *   [x] [backend] Initialize Node.js project with Express.js and TypeScript
    *   [x] [backend] Configure ESLint and Prettier
    *   [x] [backend] Set up basic API structure and routing
*   [x] [database] Database Setup (PostgreSQL)
    *   [x] [database] Install and configure PostgreSQL
    *   [x] [database] Set up database schema (users, articles, categories, tags, comments) using ORM (Prisma/TypeORM)
*   [x] [backend] [devops] Caching Setup (Redis)
    *   [x] [devops] Install and configure Redis
    *   [x] [backend] Integrate Redis client into the backend for caching

**Parallelizable tasks:** Frontend Setup, Backend Setup, Database Setup, and Caching Setup can be done in parallel after Git initialization and project structure are complete.

## 2. Core Feature Development

*   **2.1 User Authentication and Profiles:**
    *   [x] [backend] [frontend] User Registration (email/password)
    *   [backend] [frontend] User Login/Logout (JWT)
    *   [backend] [frontend] User Profiles (display info and contributions)
    *   [backend] [frontend] Password Reset
*   **2.2 Article Management:**
    *   [backend] [frontend] Create Article
        *   [frontend] Integrate rich text editor with markdown and code highlighting
    *   [backend] [frontend] Edit Article
    *   [backend] [frontend] View Article
    *   [backend] [frontend] Article Listing (with pagination)
    *   [backend] [frontend] Article Publishing/Drafts
*   **2.3 Categorization and Tagging System:**
    *   [backend] [frontend] Create/Manage Categories (admin functionality)
    *   [backend] [frontend] Create/Manage Tags (admin functionality)
    *   [backend] [frontend] Assign Categories/Tags to Articles
    *   [backend] [frontend] Browse by Category/Tag
*   **2.4 Commenting and Discussion System:**
    *   [backend] [frontend] Add Comments
    *   [backend] [frontend] Reply to Comments (nested replies)
    *   [backend] [frontend] View Comments on article pages
    *   [backend] [frontend] Comment Moderation (basic)
*   **2.5 Search Functionality:**
    *   [backend] [frontend] Basic Search (titles, content, categories, tags)
    *   [backend] [devops] Search Indexing (Elasticsearch or database full-text search)

**Parallelizable tasks:** Most features in this section can be developed in parallel, with backend and frontend components for each feature being developed concurrently. User authentication is a prerequisite for most other features.

## 3. Quality Assurance and Deployment

*   [test] Unit and Integration Tests (frontend and backend)
*   [devops] Linting and Formatting (ESLint and Prettier)
*   [devops] Security Audits (XSS, SQL injection)
*   [devops] Deployment Strategy (Vercel for frontend, cloud provider for backend/database)
*   [documentation] Update `README.md` (setup, deployment, API docs)

**Parallelizable tasks:** Unit/Integration Tests, Linting/Formatting, and Documentation can be done in parallel with feature development.

## 4. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Release)

*   Content Moderation Tools
*   Gamification (badges, points, leaderboards)
*   Personalized Recommendations
*   Code Sandbox
