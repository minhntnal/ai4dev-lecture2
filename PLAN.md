# Project Plan: Programming Knowledge-Sharing Blog Website

This document outlines the detailed plan for developing a programming knowledge-sharing blog website, incorporating features and technology recommendations derived from research and brainstorming.

## 1. Project Setup and Initialization

*   **1.1 Initialize Git Repository:** Set up a new Git repository for version control.
*   **1.2 Project Structure:** Create the basic directory structure for the monorepo (frontend, backend, shared, etc.).
*   **1.3 Frontend Setup (Next.js with TypeScript):**
    *   Initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript.
    *   Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.
    *   Set up basic UI components and styling (e.g., using Tailwind CSS or a similar framework).
*   **1.4 Backend Setup (Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript):**
    *   Initialize a Node.js project with Express.js and TypeScript.
    *   Configure ESLint and Prettier.
    *   Set up basic API structure and routing.
*   **1.5 Database Setup (PostgreSQL):**
    *   Install and configure PostgreSQL.
    *   Set up a database schema for users, articles, categories, tags, comments, etc. (using an ORM like Prisma or TypeORM).
*   **1.6 Caching Setup (Redis):**
    *   Install and configure Redis.
    *   Integrate Redis client into the backend for caching.

## 2. Core Feature Development

*   **2.1 User Authentication and Profiles:**
    *   **2.1.1 User Registration:** Implement user registration with email/password.
    *   **2.1.2 User Login/Logout:** Implement secure login and logout functionality (e.g., using JWT).
    *   **2.1.3 User Profiles:** Develop user profile pages to display user information and contributions.
    *   **2.1.4 Password Reset:** Implement password reset functionality.
*   **2.2 Article Management:**
    *   **2.2.1 Create Article:** Implement functionality for authenticated users to create new articles.
        *   Integrate a rich text editor with markdown support and code highlighting.
    *   **2.2.2 Edit Article:** Allow authors to edit their published articles.
    *   **2.2.3 View Article:** Develop a page to display individual articles.
    *   **2.2.4 Article Listing:** Create a page to list all articles, with pagination.
    *   **2.2.5 Article Publishing/Drafts:** Implement a system for articles to be in draft mode before publishing.
*   **2.3 Categorization and Tagging System:**
    *   **2.3.1 Create/Manage Categories:** Implement admin functionality to create and manage categories.
    *   **2.3.2 Create/Manage Tags:** Implement admin functionality to create and manage tags.
    *   **2.3.3 Assign Categories/Tags to Articles:** Allow authors to assign categories and tags to their articles.
    *   **2.3.4 Browse by Category/Tag:** Implement functionality to browse articles by category and tag.
*   **2.4 Commenting and Discussion System:**
    *   **2.4.1 Add Comments:** Allow authenticated users to add comments to articles.
    *   **2.4.2 Reply to Comments:** Implement nested replies for comments.
    *   **2.4.3 View Comments:** Display comments on article pages.
    *   **2.4.4 Comment Moderation:** (Initial basic moderation, can be enhanced later)
*   **2.5 Search Functionality:**
    *   **2.5.1 Basic Search:** Implement search functionality based on article titles, content, categories, and tags.
    *   **2.5.2 Search Indexing:** Consider using a search engine like Elasticsearch or a simpler database-based full-text search for better performance.

## 3. Quality Assurance and Deployment

*   **3.1 Unit and Integration Tests:** Write comprehensive tests for both frontend and backend components.
*   **3.2 Linting and Formatting:** Ensure consistent code style across the project using ESLint and Prettier.
*   **3.3 Security Audits:** Conduct basic security checks for common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
*   **3.4 Deployment Strategy:** Define a deployment strategy (e.g., Vercel for frontend, a cloud provider like AWS/GCP/Azure for backend and database).
*   **3.5 Documentation:** Update `README.md` with setup instructions, deployment guides, and API documentation.

## 4. Future Enhancements (Nice-to-Have Features)

*   **4.1 Content Moderation Tools:** Develop advanced admin tools for content review and approval.
*   **4.2 Gamification:** Implement badges, points, or leaderboards.
*   **4.3 Personalized Recommendations:** Integrate a recommendation engine.
*   **4.4 Code Sandbox:** Explore integrating an online code editor/runner.
